        <li>After creating or joining a room,<br> the Headchef (person who created the room) <br> positions the players,this will be important later in the game. </li>
        <li>At the top of the screen, it shows you the dish you need to serve.<br> Following the given dish, place the ingredients on the plate and swipe up to serve! </li>
        <li>If you do not have a certain ingredient, one your friends probably has it!<br>To pass an ingredient, simply slide the ingredient to your left or right.<br> The player who recieves it depends on who the headchef positioned on your left and right.</li>
        <li>Every round is a race against time! <br>Sadly, if a certain amount of dishes is not completed in the set time frame,<br> your group of friends will not make it to the next round. <br>New ingredients, kitchen tools and dishes will be introduced as you pass the rounds! </li>

# project-family-style
assignment 1 
Overview of project: This website is essentially built for this game called Family Style. Family Style is a 2-8 player cross-platform cooperative cooking game. 
External users' goal: The siteâ€™s users are people that are interested to download the game, know more about it and how to play it. It is also for them to decide if they want to download the game. 
Site owners' goal: The creators of the game want to promote their game and have more people playing it. They also want people to buy their merch and help new players learn how to play the game. 

Design Process
-------------------
(About page)
-as creators of the game, we want to promote our game, so that more people can download it. 

With this user story in mind, for my about page of the website i decided to share the features of this website that it may pique the interest of external users. I also decided to put pictures of game play screenshots that relate to each feature so that they would not be bored of just reading text and make my text short and concise to better engaging external users.The images can give the external user's a sneak peak of the game helping them decide whether or not to download the game.
Furthermore, chose to put brighter colors to fit the theme of the game.

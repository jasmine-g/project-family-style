Design Process
Overview of project: This website is essentially built for this game called Family Style. Family Style is a 2-8 player cross-platform cooperative cooking game. 
External user’s goal: The site’s users are people that are interested to know more about the game, how to play it and to download it. It is also for them to decide if they want to download the game. 
Site owner’s goal: The creators of the game want to promote their game and have more people playing it. They also want people to buy their merch and help new players learn how to play the game. 
I plan to make this website fun and bright and enticing to help achieve the site’s owner goal of wanting more people to download and play the game.
